Hindsight
---------

## Overview
Hindsight is a C based data processing infrastructure based on the [lua_sandbox project]
(https://github.com/mozilla-services/lua_sandbox).  So why am I working on another data
pipeline infrastructure in addition to [Heka](https://github.com/mozilla-services/heka)?

I have received several inquiries about a lighter weight and faster data pipeline
with delivery guarantees; so this project is that light weight skeleton around
the same data processing engine (lua_sandbox) with 'at least once' delivery semantics.

So how much lighter and faster? It is very preliminary but I setup a test using some
Nginx logs. The logs were split into three files each containing 1,002,646 log lines. The
test consists of parsing the Nginx logs, converting them to a Heka protobuf stream, 
and writing them back to disk.  The configurations were setup to be as equivalent as
posssible (single output, similar flush intervals, and individual readers for each
file in the concurrent test). The configs can be found here: 
https://github.com/trink/hindsight/tree/master/benchmarks.  

### Test Hardware
* Lenovo x230 Thinkpad
* Memory 8GB
* Processor Intel Core i7-3520M CPU @ 2.90GHz Ã— 4
* Disk SSD

### Test 1 - Processing a single log file

#### Hindsight
* RSS: 3064
* VIRT: 93196
* SHR: 1076
* Processing time: 8.73 seconds
* Log Lines/sec: 114,851

#### Heka (0.9)
* RSS: 39764
* VIRT: 662204
* SHR: 5240
* Processing time: 63 seconds
* Log Lines/sec: 15,915

#### Summary
* Approximately 13x less resident memory
* Approximately 7x less virtual memory
* Over 7x the throughput
* Hindsight (kill -9) Caused some corruption in the stream but no messages were lost and 3 were duplicated.
    * Error unmarshalling message at offset: 275181251 error: proto: field/encoding mismatch: wrong type for field
    * Corruption detected at offset: 275181251 bytes: 317
    * Processed: 1002650, matched: 1002649 messages

* Heka (kill -9) record count: 1,002,595 so at least 51 records were lost.


### Test 2 - Processing all three log files concurrently

#### Hindsight
* RSS: 4868
* VIRT: 241492
* SHR: 1092
* Processing time: 15.7 seconds
* Log Lines/sec: 191,588

#### Heka (0.9)
* RSS: 42060
* VIRT: 801432
* SHR: 5256
* Processing time: 198 second
* Log Lines/sec: 15,192  # actually slower than processing them sequentially

#### Summary
* Approximately 8.6x less resident memory
* Approximately 3.3x less virtual memory
* Over 12.6x the throughput
