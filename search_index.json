(0.14.9)","keywords":"","body":"Hindsight\n1. Overview\nHindsight is a C based data processing infrastructure based on the\nlua sandbox project. I have\nreceived several inquiries about a lighter weight and faster data pipeline with\ndelivery guarantees to replace Heka.\nHindsight is that light weight skeleton around the same lua sandbox offering 'at\nleast once' delivery semantics.\nSo how much lighter and faster? see: Performance\n2. Table of Contents\n\nArchitecture\nConfiguration\nCommand Line Version\nHeka Sandbox Documentation\nSandbox Extensions Documentation\n\n2.1. Differences from Heka\n\nSandbox API Differences\nThe message matcher now uses Lua string match patterns instead of RE2\nexpressions.\nLooping messages in Heka (injecting messages back to an earlier point in the\npipeline) has always been a bad idea so it was removed. Most looping\nrequirements can be flattened out: i.e., alerting can be handled in the output\nplugins, aggregation/sessionization can be handled in the inputs.\nSplitters/Decoders/Encoders no longer exist they simply become part of the\ninput/output plugins respectively. The common functionality should now be broken\nout into Lua modules to allow for re-use in different plugins.\nCheckpoint are all managed by the Hindsight infrastructure (so much of the\nburden is removed from the plugin writer, this also alters the plugin API\nslightly and should greatly lower the checkpoint related IOPS when compared\nto Heka).\n\nHindsight1. Overview2. Table of Contents2.1. Differences from Heka"},"architecture.html":{"url":"architecture.html","title":"Architecture","keywords":"","body":"Architecture\nHindsight consists of three types of plugins: Input, Analysis, and Output. All\nplugins are written in Lua and based on the\nLua Sandbox project.\n1. Input Plugins\nInput plugins are used to transform external data formats into a Heka messages\nfor processing.  Each input plugin runs on a dedicated thread and all messages\ngenerated by the plugins are multiplexed to a single output stream.\n2. Analysis Plugins\nAnalysis plugins are used for simple or complex event processing such as:\naggregation, sessionization, anomaly detection etc.  Analysis plugins can share\na thread of execution; the work distribution across threads is user configurable\nand can be tailored to specific use cases and needs e.g., by performance\ncharacteristics, work load distribution or type. Every analysis thread uses a\ndedicated reader to process the data stream produced by the input plugins. The\nmessages generated by all analysis plugins are multiplexed to a single output\nstream.\n3. Output Plugins\nOutput plugins are used transform the internal Heka messages into whatever\nformat is needed e.g., txt, html, tsv, alternate binary encoding. The\nmessage/transformation can then be feed to other systems such as data\nwarehouses, information retrieval indexes, dashboards, notifiers etc. Each\noutput plugin runs on a dedicated thread and has its own readers to process the\ndata stream produced by the input and analysis plugins. If the output plugin is\nsubscribed to both the input and analysis streams they are multiplexed with the\noldest message being delivered first.\n4. Sample High Level Data Flow\n\n5. Reliability\n5.1. Durability\nThe durability of the data is equal to durability of storage where the\noutput_path (data stream files and state preservation files) is configured.\n5.2. Delivery Guarantee\nThe at least once delivery guarantee only applies to software failures. There\nare no guarantees if the underlying storage system fails. Crashing or killing\nthe Hindsight process should not cause any messages to be lost or skipped and\nwill, at most, duplicate/re-process one second of data on restart. However,\nsandbox state is only preserved on a clean shutdown i.e., if an analysis plugin\nwas counting the number of messages going through the system, and the system was\nkilled, the count would be reset to last saved state. This behaviour should be\ntaken into account for any plugins performing and preserving stateful analysis.\n5.3. Dynamic Plugin Loading\nThe Hindsight infrastructure can be run as a service with no initial business\nlogic loaded since all plugin types can be dynamically loaded and unloaded as\nnecessary.\nsandbox_load_path = \"hs_load\"\nsandbox_run_path  = \"hs_run\"\n\n5.4. Starting a New Plugin\n\ncp test.lua hs_load/analysis/test.lua\ncp my_test.cfg hs_load/analysis/my_test.cfg\ncp your_test.cfg hs_load/analysis/your_test.cfg\nHindsight scans the directory\ntest.lua is moved to hs_run/analysis/test.lua\nmy_test.cfg is moved to hs_run/analysis/my_test.cfg\nHindsight attempts to run my_test.cfg\nyour_test.cfg is moved to hs_run/analysis/your_test.cfg\nHindsight attempts to run your_test.cfg\n\n5.5. Restarting a Plugin\n\ncp my_test.cfg hs_load/analysis/my_test.cfg\nHindsight scans the directory\nmy_test.cfg is moved to hs_run/analysis/my_test.cfg\nHindsight attempts to restart my_test.cfg (no data gaps/loss)\n\n5.6. Updating the Business Logic\n\ncp test.lua hs_load/analysis/test.lua\nHindsight scans the directory 1. test.lua is moved to\nhs_run/analysis/test.lua\nHindsight attempts to restart my_test.cfg and your_test.cfg since they use\nthe same underlying business logic (no data gaps/loss)\n\n5.7. Stopping a Plugin\n\ntouch hs_load/analysis/my_test.off\nHindsight scans the directory\nhs_load/analysis/my_test.off is deleted\nhs_run/analysis/my_test.cfg is renamed to hs_run/analysis/my_test.off\nHindsight stops my_test.cfg\n\nArchitecture1.

The\nonly thing required to configure the basic syslog decoder is the template\nconfiguration specified in the\nrsyslog.conf\nfile. The template below is the RSYSLOG_TraditionalFileFormat without the new\nline at the end since that is consumed by the file input.
